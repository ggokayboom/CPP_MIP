#  Coverage Path Planning with Mixed Integer Programming

This repos are re-written from https://github.com/Idate96/MIP-for-path-planning 

## Prerequisites
 - Gurobi
 - Please refer requirements.txt

## Usage
Run the main file with the number of the experiment number from 0 to 1. For example to run experiment 0:

```python
python src/test.py 0
```
This will save the result figures and data(csv format) in the result folder
